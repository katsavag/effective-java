## 📘 Item 1: Consider Static Factory Methods Instead of Constructors

### 📝 Description

A *static factory method* is a static method that returns an instance of a class. Unlike constructors, they have names, can return instances of any subtype of their return type, and can return pre-existing instances.

Instead of this:

```java
public class Color {
    public Color(int r, int g, int b) { ... }
}
```

You can use:

```java
public class Color {
    public static Color fromRGB(int r, int g, int b) { ... }
}
```

This design allows more flexibility and expressiveness than constructors.

### 🚦 When to Use It

* When you need **named alternatives** to constructors for better readability.
* When creating instances is **complex or has variations** (e.g., caching, conditional logic).
* When you want to **return a subtype** or an existing instance (singleton, flyweight, etc.).
* When you want to **hide the implementation class** from the API user.

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Improved readability** through meaningful method names.
* **Flexibility** to return any subtype or a cached instance.
* **Control over instance creation** (e.g., singleton pattern).
* **Can reduce the number of classes exposed to API users.**
* Allows **non-instantiable classes** via private constructors with only factory methods.

---

### ⚠️ Negatives / Caveats

* **Not immediately recognizable as object creators** (less familiar to some developers).
* **Classes without public constructors can’t be subclassed**, limiting inheritance.
* **Can be verbose** if overused or poorly named.
* **No built-in support for compile-time polymorphism** (can’t use `new` keyword).

## 📘 Item 2: Consider a Builder When Faced with Many Constructor Parameters

### 📝 Description

When a class has many parameters—especially if some are optional—a *builder* is a flexible and readable way to construct instances. It overcomes the limitations of telescoping constructors and improves clarity over using a constructor with many parameters.

### 🚦 When to Use It

* When a class has **multiple parameters**, especially if many are optional.
* When **readability, clarity, and immutability** are important.
* When you want **immutable objects** with controlled construction logic.
* When **object construction logic is complex** or requires validation.

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Improved readability and clarity**: it's obvious what each value represents.
* **Scalable to large numbers of parameters** without constructor overloading.
* **Encourages immutability**, making objects easier to reason about.
* **Allows for optional parameters** cleanly and safely.
* Enables **step-by-step construction and validation**.

---

### ⚠️ Negatives / Caveats

* **More verbose** than constructors for simple objects.
* Slightly **higher learning curve** than traditional constructors.
* **Requires additional classes or inner classes**, increasing boilerplate.
* Can be **overkill for small, simple data structures**.
