## 📘 Item 1: Consider Static Factory Methods Instead of Constructors

### 📝 Description

A *static factory method* is a static method that returns an instance of a class. Unlike constructors, they have names, can return instances of any subtype of their return type, and can return pre-existing instances.

Instead of this:

```java
public class Color {
    public Color(int r, int g, int b) { ... }
}
```

You can use:

```java
public class Color {
    public static Color fromRGB(int r, int g, int b) { ... }
}
```

This design allows more flexibility and expressiveness than constructors.

### 🚦 When to Use It

* When you need **named alternatives** to constructors for better readability.
* When creating instances is **complex or has variations** (e.g., caching, conditional logic).
* When you want to **return a subtype** or an existing instance (singleton, flyweight, etc.).
* When you want to **hide the implementation class** from the API user.

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Improved readability** through meaningful method names.
* **Flexibility** to return any subtype or a cached instance.
* **Control over instance creation** (e.g., singleton pattern).
* **Can reduce the number of classes exposed to API users.**
* Allows **non-instantiable classes** via private constructors with only factory methods.

---

### ⚠️ Negatives / Caveats

* **Not immediately recognizable as object creators** (less familiar to some developers).
* **Classes without public constructors can’t be subclassed**, limiting inheritance.
* **Can be verbose** if overused or poorly named.
* **No built-in support for compile-time polymorphism** (can’t use `new` keyword).
